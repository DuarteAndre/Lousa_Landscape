## Contribution to the study of the hardwoods in the Lousã Municipally. An approach to landscape level.

The desertion of the rural place coupled with the intensification of the forest management and dramatic fires are responsible for the greatest alterations in our landscapes. This study was conducted in a region of central Portugal, Lousã, with an area of 13 841 ha and it aims to characterize the patches of native and invasive broadleaves and also, to study its relationship with biophysical and anthropogenic
variables.
We used aerial photographs from the year of 2010 to make the photo-interpretation onscreen using a scale of 1:3000 and a minimum area of 100 m2. After the photointerpretation, the information was validated with the data collected in field. All the available information was compiled with biophysical and anthropogenic variables.
